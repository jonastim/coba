This is not the full story though because what is plotted above is the average over all of our data sets and so it can hide extreme errors. By hidden extremes what we mean is this, imagine two people are trying to estimate the height of a five foot tall person. We will call our two people estimators. The first estimator guesses the person is 3' tall and 7' tall while the second estimator guesses the person is 4'11\" and 5'1\" tall. Now both of these people were correct on average (i.e., for both estimators their average estimate was 5' which was the ground truth) but one of them we could argue was a better estimator because not only were they right on average but their estimates were also close to the ground truth. This is what we mean by hidden extremes. To look for this we create a contrast plot."

We can also see that while IPS is off base its standard deviation is a little smaller than DM.

    "The plot above shows the average difference between ground truth and IPS/DM. The orange line is the DM error with standard deviations while the blue line is IPS error. We can see that DM error consistent. It doesn't improve, doesn't get worse. It starts out really good and just kidn of stays there. The IPS estimator on the other hand starts off pretty horribly and gets better and better. It's still not great by the end but this trend would continue. Given another 5,000 examples or so IPS would almost certainly do better than DM. And here's the secret to DR. Doubly robust is a combination of DM and IPS. So, it will start off strong like DM while also getting better and better with more data like IPS. "
